# R3-SoftwareTraining-SiamChowdhury

 initially started off with the wiring. I wired up one motor to the motor controller along with the arduino, 9V battery and the potentiometer. With a bit of tinkering, I was able to get this working well. 
 
 After this, I added the second motor.It was pretty much more of the same as the first motor, so I was able to get it working quite easily.
 
 After this however, I started running into problems.
 
 I tried adding in the DIP switches, but couldn't get them working. I tried searching it up on the internet, but couldn't find any good resources on it. I eventually ran out of time and had to abandon the DIP switches.
 
 They are still on the circuit though, so you can see if I wired something incorrectly or what.
 
 When I realised I couldn't get hte switches working in time, I decided to just call the various methods in the loop outside the if statements to show that I did get the motors working properly.
